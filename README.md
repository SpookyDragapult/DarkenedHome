I'm not using vite so you'll have to do things manually.
to run the frontend just enter the directory by typing in "cd frontend/moa-side" to the terminal and then install update by typing "npm install" and finally  type "npm start" and you're set
to run the backend simply enter the directory by, again, typing in "cd backend" to the terminal and install update by typing "npm install" and type "node server.js" (if you're using nodemon then type "nodemon server.js" instead)
